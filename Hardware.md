# Used Hardware #

The list of hardware usde for this project:
  * Pioneer P3-DX
  * Arduino Mega`*`
  * RS232 Shield
  * APM 2.5
  * Futaba T8J
  * Futaba R2008SB
  * 2x 3DR Radio 433MHz
  * GTPA010

`*`The arduino is being powered internally by the Pioneer. The power is provided through a 5V port and a stripped USB Type B cable.

# Used Software #

To realise this project the following software was used:
  * Arduino IDE
  * Mission Planner

The APM runs on the latest version of ArduRover available from Mission Planner. The Arduino runs on the source available in the project Repository.
